### Technologies Used
- **Framework**: Nuxt.js (Vue.js)
- **Styling**: SCSS
- **Grid System**: Bootstrap
- **Slider**: Swiper
- **Data Source**: [anasayfa.json API](https://turkmedya.com.tr/anasayfa.json)

### Features
- Desktop-optimized layout for screens 1024px and above.
- Dynamic slider populated with data from the anasayfa.json API.
- Modular SCSS structure for maintainable and scalable styling.
- Bootstrap Grid for consistent layout alignment.
- Smooth and intuitive user experience with Swiper slider integration.
